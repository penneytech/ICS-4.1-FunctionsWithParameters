/*

In this excercise you will add two numbers together. 

1) Declare two varaibles for 'x' and 'y' - set the initial values for each to any number between 1 and 500.

2) Create a function 'addNumbers' with two parameters called 'num1' and 'num2'. Name the function whatever you'd like. 

3) Call the 'addNumbers' function and use X and Y as the parameter values - e.g. addNumbers(x, y) 

4) Log the result to the console from within the 'addNumbers' function.

NOTE: For step 3, you can do one of two things:

1) Declare a variable in the 'addNumbers' function for the 'answer', set answer to equal 'num1 + num2', and log it to the console.
2) Or, use 'console.log(num1 + num2)'
